# 🌤️ Weather Forecast - Machine Learning Model

This repository contains a **machine learning-based weather temperature prediction project**.  
It demonstrates a complete workflow from **data preprocessing and model training** (in Jupyter/Colab) to **deployment-ready packaging** (via Streamlit or API).

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
The model predicts **temperature (°C)** based on key atmospheric parameters:
- **Humidity (%)**
- **Wind Speed (km/h)**
- **Pressure (hPa)**

The model was trained and evaluated in Colab, then exported using `joblib`.  
The app component (`app.py`) is prepared for deployment with **Streamlit**, but **UI is currently disabled** for this version.
